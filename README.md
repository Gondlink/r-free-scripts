# r-free-scripts
This is the list of free scripts I did for the people at r/free.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
**In order to run these scripts, you need to download AutoHotKey at https://www.autohotkey.com/**                                                                          
Also, whatever is before the "::" at the start of the script is what starts it.
